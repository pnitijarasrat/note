# Deep Work Key Takeaway

## Idea

### The only winners of the new Enonomic

- The Skilled Worker
- The Superstar
- The Owner ( access to the capital )

### How to join one of the first two winners

- Be able to learn hard thing
- Be able to produce at an elite level ( at high quality and speed )

> Deepwork helps us do both.

### Busyness as Proxy to Productivity

- This is _dump_ statement and _dumpest_ way to tell if someone is productive or not.
- Shifting between tasks reduces _attention_

> Quality of work = Working Hour x Intensity of Focus
