# Technology Overview

## On Goings

- Operation Sheet [Branch Operation Sheet Requirement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lSovFspmEAce3sJZb8Hy_a_efFmiLYOCWUaFuq9giRs/edit)
- Financial Report Sheet for Operation
- Demand Monitoring System ( for Operator )
- Tech Infrastructure Proposal
- API from Advisory Board works, UI will be made shortly

## Waiting

- Operation Sheet Requirement ( Branch Manager, Area Manager, COO Sheet ) ( Only have branch operator for now )
- Operation Dashboard Requirement
- Evaluation Process
- Evaluation Feature Requirement
- New Evaluation Criteria for Tech Department ( and others!? )

## Going to Happen for sure

- Make report for Marketing
- Storing data in DB from Operation
  ( all cost related ) for Finance and Marketing or whatever
- Make a report from the DB ( need data scientist ? )

## Information

### Board

- Technology needs to implement **_every_** tech related possible. Ex. If Marketing deploys Royalty Program, Tech needs to build system for that.
- Demand from board will be by **_transaction_**
- Late, Defect, Missing items rate will be sent with Demand

### Marketing

### Finance

### Operation

### Executive

## Current Questions

- When will marketing need to use the data? after Q2 ?
- Finance too ?
- What thing is going to happen after Q2 run? Quarter by quarter ?
- Supplier Factor ( late, defect ) pretty not sure about this for this moment
- Date Format ( I assume that it's up to Tech Department )
- Operating Process ( all stakeholder, from operator to C level )

## Need to Figure out

- How to put all transaction from operator to DB?
- How will other departments input their investment or cost related topics?

## Concern

- Current Score -- They say it will be 35 for all of Technology Project -- talked with Tawan, she confirmed 35 for every Tech project.
