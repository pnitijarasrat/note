# ICO

```
Token is a Digital Representation of Value
```

## Token Type

- Utility Token
- Security Token
- Payment Token
- Stable Coin

### Utility Token

- Token for accessing to Products, Services, or anything inside the Blockchain
- Suppose to be used, not invest
- Must be in ICO
- For example, ETH, ADA

### Security Token

- Digital Representation of Security
- For example, Bond, Real Estate, Stock
- Pretty far from us.

### Payment Token

- Cryptocurrency ex. Bitcoin

### Stable Coin

- Real currency within Blockchain ex USDC, USDT

## Blockchain

- _Distributed Ledger_
- Every block in the chain record every transaction detail as you can imagined
- The new block is created when people sovle the **Algorithm**

## Algorithm

```
Process used to verify the ownership of the Token value
```

### Proof of Work (BTC Chain)

- Use your computer to solve Hash function
- Once the Hash is solved. The solver is reward by BTC
- The process is used to verify the ownership of the BTC value.

### Proof of Stake

- Proof of Work alternative
- The owner of coin choose the way to verify the block themselves via _Validation_
- Validator must own enough coin for example 32 ETH can validate Ethereum Block
- Less computational work and Competitive

## PoW vs PoS

- Miner vs Validator
- Buy Equipment vs Buy Coin
- Not energy efficient vs Energy efficient
- Secure with expensive equipment vs Secure by Community
- Block reward vs Transaction fee reward

## Process of Proof of Stake

1. Staking - Lock their token for security deposit and their commitment to maintain the network and receive staking reward, transaction fee, Governance Participation (Previllege)
2. Validator Selection - depend of Size of the stake
3. Block Proposal
4. Validation - other validator verify the proposed block
5. Finalization - the block is added to the blockchain

## Distribution Plan

1. Total Token Supply = Estimated Users x Transaction/User/Year

Example

- Estimated Users = 500,000
- Transaction/User/Year = 1000 Token annually
- Total Token Supple = 500,000,000 Token
- Longevity and Growth: if the project would last long may be double from the calculation

2. Distribution Plan

- ICO - big enough to attract investment (~20-30%)
- Team and Advisors - (~10%) for motivation. apply vesting schedules ( 1 year - no token, 2-4 years - 1000 tokens, etc)
- Community Incentives - (~30-40%) for community should be large
- Reserve - for unforseen expense (~20%)
- Partnerships and Development - (~10-20%)

3. Pricing

- Fixed
- Dutch Auction -> decrease overtime === fair market price
- Dynamic \* -> demand and supply

4. Vesting Schedules

## Token Rate

1. Block Creation Rate - faster = less secure, faster transaction comfirmation
2. Optimal Staking Reward

- ROR
- Calculate Inflation - 5% created 1% burn = 4% inflation
- Regular Creation Rate ~ 4-5% of Total Supply
- Regular Burn Rate ~ 0.5-2% of Total Supply
