```

## Token Type

- Utility Token

## Blockchain

- _Distributed Ledger_
- Every block in the chain record every transaction detail as you can imagined
- The new block is created when people sovle the **Algorithm**

## Algorithm

```
Process used to verify the ownership of the Token value
```

### Proof of Work (BTC Chain)

- Use your computer to solve Hash function
- Once the Hash is solved. The solver is reward by BTC
- The process is used to verify the ownership of the BTC value.

### Proof of Stake

- Proof of Work alternative
- The owner of coin choose the way to verify the block themselves via _Validation_
- Validator must own enough coin for example 32 ETH can validate Ethereum Block
- Less computational work and Competitive

## PoW vs PoS

- Miner vs Validator
- Buy Equipment vs Buy Coin
- Not energy efficient vs Energy efficient
- Secure with expensive equipment vs Secure by Community
- Block reward vs Transaction fee reward
